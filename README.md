# Introduction <br>
This tutorial walks step-by-step tutorial of analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN. In my experience, I found you can generally use the same analysis workflow for the two types of experiment, but there are studies proposing tailored CUT&RUN analysis tools such as [SEACR](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-019-0287-4), you are welcome to experimening orthogonal approaches and becnchmark their performance.
