# Introduction <br>
This tutorial walks step-by-step tutorial of analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN. In my experience, I found you can generally use the same analysis workflow for the two types of experiment, but there are studies proposing tailored CUT&RUN analysis tools such as [SEACR](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-019-0287-4), you are welcome to experimening orthogonal approaches and becnchmark their performance.

To create a table of contents in a GitHub README file, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Generate the Table of Contents
GitHub README files use Markdown, a lightweight markup language. To create a table of contents, you can use the list of headers in your README file.

Identify the headers in your README file. Headers in Markdown are denoted using hashtags (#).
Determine the hierarchy of your headers. Markdown supports six levels of headers, denoted by one to six hashtags (#). For example, # represents a top-level header, ## represents a second-level header, and so on.
Copy the text of your headers, excluding the hashtags.
Create a list of links to your headers, formatted as Markdown links. Use the following format: [Header Text](#header-link). Replace Header Text with the text of your header and header-link with a simplified version of your header text, with spaces replaced by hyphens and all characters lowercase.
Arrange the list of links in the order of your headers, indented to represent the hierarchy.
